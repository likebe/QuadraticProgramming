How to use the QP Sector Asset-Allocation Simulator:

To be successfully running the code, please download project.ipynb and
DATA.xlsx and save them to the save directory. Also, please make sure all
the relevant packages are installed, namely, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, 
seaborn, and qpsolvers.

In order to run the run_simulation code, which is the core of the simulation,
please make sure all the previous cells are already run. The users are able 
to select the look-back window length and the return level by changing the 
value of the arguments in the run_simulation function. Once finish running 
the whole project, the corresponding figures or plots will be saved into 
the same file directory.


We thank you very much for using our code!
